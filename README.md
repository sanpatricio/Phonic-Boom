Phonic Boom
=======

Phonic Boom reads music files and meta-data from a directory and outputs the
details in an HTML friendly format.

Once pbIndexer.pl is run from a command line, the resulting output.html will
contain a ul/li list of mp3s formatted based on the meta tags associated
with the file.
